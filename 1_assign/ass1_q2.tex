\subsection*{Answer}
First loop the set to find the minimum $y_{min}$ in O(n) as there
are n elements in the set. Since $y_i$, $c_i$ and $E$ are positive
integers, and $y_i = c_i + E$, the maximum value for $E$ is $y_{min} - 1$.
We know the value of $y_i$ and $x_i$, and $S =
\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{x_i}{y_i-E} $. Hence, we try 
$E = y_{min} - 1$, put it in $
\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{x_i}{y_i-E} $ and calculate the sum, which takes
$O(n)$, then do comparison with $S$. If it equals to $S$, we get the correct $E$ and 
then use $E$ to get all the correct values of fractions $x_i/c_i$ in O(n).
If it does not equal to S, we try another value of $E$ in 
a binary search way. We first try half of it, i.e. $
\frac{y_{min} - 1}{2}$ (round it to an integer if it is not an integer), then
compare it with $S$. If it equals to $S$, we get the correct $E$; if it is smaller
than S, it means the value of $E$ we try is smaller than the correct one
($\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{x_i}{y_i-E}$ and $E$ are in positive correlation),
so choose a higher value of $E$ in binary search way; the same approach also 
applies when the sum is bigger than $E$, in that case we try a smaller $E$ (binary 
search in lower value direction).
 We keep doing the process until 
we find the correct $E$, then easily get all ${x_i}/{c_i}$ in time $O(n)$. As each search query we calculate a sum in $O(n)$, and the 
maximum times of query is $\log{y_{min}}$, the whole binary search process takes $O(n\log{y_{min}})$. 
So it can find all the correct values of fractions ${x_i}/{c_i}$ by this
method in time $O(n\log{y_{min}})$.
