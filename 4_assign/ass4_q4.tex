\subsection*{Answer}
We initialise a 2D array board with size $n \times n$, 
then for each white shop $s_i$,
based on its position $(a_i, b_i)$, we mark board[$a_i$][$b_i$] and all 
entries on its diagonal directions as ``attacked".\\
Model this as a max flow problem. We construct a 
bipartite graph with vertices on the left side 
representing $n$ rows in the board,  denoted as $r_i$,
and vertices on the left side representing $n$ columns of 
the board, denoted as $l_i$.
Introduce a super source and a super sink.
Connect each $r_i$ with the super source 
by a directed edge of capacity equal to 1.
Connect each $l_i$ with the super
sink with a directed edge of capacity equal to 1.
For constructing the edges between $r_i$ and $l_i$, we check 
the array we made, if board[$r_i$][$l_i$] is not marked as 
``attacked" (means the position is not under attacked by white bishop), 
we construct a edge from $r_i$ to $l_i$, with capacity equal to 
1. \\
Now, the largest number of black rooks we can place is the max flow 
of our constructed graph. We run Edmonds-Karp algorithm on our
graph to get the residual graph. In the Ô¨Ånal residual graph, 
the sum of the weight of the incoming edges towards source equals to 
the max flow, which is the largest number we are looking for.\\\\
Time complexity: constructing the 2D array board takes $O(kn)$, $k \le n^2$.
Since the time complexity of 
Edmonds-Karp algorithm is $O( | V || E | ^2 )$, 
where $|E|$ is the number of edges, $| V |$ is the number of 
vertices, we have maximum $2n + n^2$ edges, 
and $2n + 2$ vertices in the constructed graph, 
hence the time complexity to get the  max flow is $O((2n + 2) \cdot (2n+n^2)^2) = O(n^5)$.
Therefore the overall time complexity of our algorithm is $O(kn) + O(n^5) = O(n^5)$.
