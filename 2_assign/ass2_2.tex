\subsection*{Answer}
First we sort $N$ workers based on their skill level $x_i$ in ascending order, and 
$P$ entry-level jobs based on their maximum accept skill level $p_i$ in ascending order, and 
$Q$ senior jobs based on their minimum accept skill level $q_i$ in ascending order.
This sorting process takes time $O(N log N + P log P + Q log Q)$ in total. \\
Going from the least skilled to the most skilled worker, assign each worker a entry-level
job with the lowest $p_i$ that they meet and has not been assigned, if one exists. The remaining
workers, that is who has not been assigned a work, going from the least skilled to the most skilled, 
assign each remaining worker a senior job with the highest $q_i$ that they meet and has not been assigned, if one
exist. This assigning process takes time $O(N)$.\\
So the total time taken is $O(N log N + N + P log P + Q log Q) = O(N log N + P log P + Q log Q)$, which
satisfies the question.
