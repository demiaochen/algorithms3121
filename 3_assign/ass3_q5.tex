\subsection*{Answer}
We first initialise a 2D array with size $|V|$ x $|V|$, weight$[|V|][|V|]$, to store 
the weights between two vertices in $G(V, E)$. The diagonal entries in weight$[|V|][|V|]$ will be 0, as visiting 
a node from itself will have no weight. Nodes not directly reachable will be infinity.\\
Second initialise a 3D array of size $|V|$ x $|V|$ x $K$, dp$[s][d][k]$, to represent the maximum total wight path from
node $s$ to $d$ using exactly $k$ edges in total. Initialise the whole array to infinity except for $d = s$, which sets to 0.\\
We now start finding the the maximum total weight path.
For each $s$ in $V$ ($V$ is the set of vertex in graph $G$), we loop $K$ times, in each loop we 
examine every $d$ in $V$, and update dp by do the following:
\[
    dp[s][d][k+1] = max(arr[s][i][k]+weight[i][d])
\]
for all i which has an edge from i to d, i.e. $weight[i][d]$ is not infinity or 0. \\
Here $arr[s][i][k]$ is a copy of $dp[s][d][k]$ before updating dp.\\
After finishing above, we loop to find the maximum number in dp$[s][d][K]$, which is the 
the maximum total weight of exactly length $K$ we can get from $G$. \\
To get path, we use a recursive function and an array path[] to store the path, $$
    opt(s, d, k) = max\{opt(s, i, k)+weight[i][d]: \mbox{weight[i][d] is not infinity or 0}\}
$$
We add all $i$ chosen from max\{\} to array path, where $i$ represents each node visited, and reverse path when finishing the whole recursive process, then
we get the maximum total weight of exactly length $K$ path from the array path.\\
Time complexity is $O(K*|V|^2)$, as we have $|V|$ vertices in $G$, we have chosen every vertex as 
source node $s$, and for each source node $s$ we loop $K$ times to check every destination node $d$. Hence
the time complexity is $O(|V|* K *|V|)$ = $O(K*|V|^2)$.
